Research
======

* **Capital One, Research Fellow** — *Dec 2024 – Present, Los Angeles, CA*
  
  Received the award to support research into robust optimization algorithms with Professor Johanes Royset. Work includes designing fault-tolerant machine learning loss functions and Rockafellians to help identify credit fraud with noisy or overcomplete datasets.

* **Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM), Quantum Algorithms Researcher** — *Jun 2024 – Present, Los Angeles, CA*
  
  Conducting research with Dr. Jeff Marshal and Dr. Namit Anand at NASA Ames to develop efficient algorithms for the classical simulation of high-depth noisy quantum circuits. Work included high performance simulation using multiprocessing and CUDA. Achieved the only practically situatable noisy quantum circuit of depth 10,000 (700x current state of the art).

* **UCLA MFG Lab, Mean Field Games Researcher** — *Jun 2023 – Jun 2024, Los Angeles, CA*
  
  Research under Professor Wilfrid Gangbo on a multi-population mean field game model of inter-bank lending to study the relationship between different population-risk profiles and system failure.

* **Red Hen Labs, Optimal Control Researcher** — *Mar 2023 – May 2024, Los Angeles, CA*
  
  Research with Professor Francis Stein involving the use of model predictive control (MPC) with cognition constraints to simulate prospection. Work includes Python implementation of MPC systems and cognitive science data fitting.

* **KAUST, NUMPDE Lab, Mixed Finite Elements Researcher** — *Apr 2023 – Jul 2023, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia*
  
  Worked under Professor Daniele Boffi on the numerical approximation of PDEs using mixed finite element methods. Developed a fictitious domain formulation with distributed Lagrange multipliers for fluid-structure interaction problems, and compiled a standard Python library.

* **UCLA Communication News Archive, Machine Learning Engineer** — *Aug 2022 – Present, Los Angeles, CA*
  
  Collaborated with Professor Tim Groeling on single-linkage clustering to detect show boundaries in UCLA’s Rosenthal News Collection. Also developed a transcription and translation pipeline for multilingual news for use in linguistics and public policy.

* **UCLA Paris Labs, Stochastic Optimization Researcher** — *Oct 2020 – Jun 2022, Los Angeles, CA*
  
  Research with Professor Mathieu Bauchy involving ML and stochastic optimization for amorphous materials. Built a particle swarm optimizer with simulated annealing to generate glass compositions with specified properties.

Industry Experience
======
* **Google, Summer of Code Participant** — *May 2024 – Aug 2024, Los Angeles, CA*
  
  Used deep reinforcement learning and quantum circuits to model the probabilistic behavior of *Stentor Roseli*. Developed a quantum circuit to simulate protist decision making with 93% accuracy. Implemented and tested DQN variants using OpenAI Gym.

* **UBS, Wealth Management / Data Analyst Intern** — *Dec 2022 – Apr 2024, Los Angeles, CA*
  
  Built NLP pipelines to scrape news articles for client prospects. Developed decision tree-based models to rank prospects by fit.

* **Sentient.io, Machine Learning Researcher** — *Jul 2022 – Jan 2023, Singapore*
  
  Built validation/testing pipelines for audio emotion recognition AI. Implemented phonetic transcription (IPA → Arphabet) and deployed speech and pose recognition models via Docker.

* **Origgin Venture Capital, Data Analyst Intern** — *Jun 2022 – Aug 2022, Singapore*
  
  Used zero-shot learning and statistical tools to detect trends in patent data and helped automate reporting of emerging green energy IP.

* **Vulcan Value Partners, Machine Learning Engineer Intern** — *Jun 2021 – Oct 2021, Birmingham, AL*
  

* **Duffl, Project Manager / Data Analyst** — *Oct 2020 – Mar 2022, Los Angeles, CA*
  
  Led a team to build the app’s recommendation engine. Developed NLP and Bayesian models for inventory predictions and delivery optimization.
