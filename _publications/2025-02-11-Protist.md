 The single-celled protist Stentor roselii has long been observed to exhibit complex decision-making behaviors, yet existing machine learning and classical computational models have struggled to replicate its actions. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum-statistical framework to model S. roselii’s behavioral responses to environmental stimuli. By leveraging
 quantum circuits with amplitude dampening and memory effects, we construct a quantum behavioral model that captures the probabilistic and hierarchical nature of S. roselii’s decision making. Our results suggest that quantum statistical theory provides a promising tool for representing and simulating biological decision processes.
